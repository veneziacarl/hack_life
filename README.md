**Description**


Built collaboratively using TDD and agile development, this app is a portal for learning lifeâ€™s greatest tricks and letting the world know how you feel about them.


Maximizing efficiency is a key part of life. We built this site as a tool for the community to find processes that will streamline even the little things in in their day-to-day lives.  The site allows people to communicate brilliant ideas that make life easier and, through crowdsourcing, the community can refine which ideas are most useful.
